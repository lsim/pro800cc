## Unofficial Behringer Pro-800 CC list

I haven't been able to find official documentation on this, but someone posted a definition file for the Squarp Pyramid [here](https://squarp.community/t/behringer-pro-800-definition-file/9720). I needed a nice readable single page document for my reMarkable, so I reformatted the squarp definition into the two files in this repo. Maybe it could be useful to someone else.

Feel free to make a PR if you find errors or have additions
